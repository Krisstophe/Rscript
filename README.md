How the script works
===========
This is a guide about how to use "run_analysis.R" script to get tidy data.

*Click the download file "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset" to expand it, and you'll have a folder "UCI HAR Dataset" with  another two folders and four text files in it.
*Open Rstudio.
*File -> Open File, load the script "run_analysis.R".
*Use setwd command to set "UCI HAR Dataset" as your working directory in the console window.
*Run script.
*After R studio's work, you'll get a tidy data named "tidydata.txt" in your working directory.
