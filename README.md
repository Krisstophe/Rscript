How the script works
===========
This is a guide about how to use "run_analysis.R" script to get tidy data.

1. Click the download file "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset" to expand it, and you'll have a folder "UCI HAR Dataset" with another two folders and four text files in it.
2. Open Rstudio.
3. File -> Open File, load the script "run_analysis.R".
4. Use setwd command to set "UCI HAR Dataset" as your working directory in the console window.
5. Run script.
6. After R studio's work, you'll get a tidy data named "tidydata.txt" in your working directory.

GOOD LUCK!
